    - run.analysis.R: R Script for collecting and analyzing messy data into tiny data.         Before running this script, make sure to do the following prerequisites:
    1. Set the working directory to folder containing this R script.
    2. Add the unzipped dataset to the current working directory

    - CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed.
